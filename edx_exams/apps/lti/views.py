# We do not want Django's CSRF protection enabled for POSTs made by external services to this endpoint.
# This is because Django uses the double-submit cookie method of CSRF protection, but the Proctoring Specification
# lends itself better to the synchronizer token method of CSRF protection.
# Django's method requires an anti-CSRF token to be included in both a cookie and a hidden from value in the request
# to CSRF procted endpoints.
# In the Proctoring Specification, there are a number of issues supporting the double-submit cookie method.
# 1. Django requires that a cookie is sent with the request to the Assessment Platform that contains the anti-CSRF
#    token. When the learner's browser makes a request to the start_proctoring view, an anti-CSRF token is set in the
#    cookie.
#    The default SameSite attribute for cookies is "Lax" (stored in the Django setting CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE),
#    meaning that when the Proctoring Tool redirects the learner's browser back to the Assessment Platform, the browser
#    will not include the previously set cookie in its request to the Assessment Platform. CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE can be
#    set to "None", but this means that all third-party cookies will be included by the browser, which may compromise
#    CSRF protection for other endpoints. Note that settings CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE to "None" requires that
#    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE is set to True.
# 2. Django validates a request by comparing the above anti-CSRF token in the cookie to the anti-CSRF token in the POST
#    request parameters. Django expects the anti-CSRF token to be in the POST request parameters with the name
#    "csrfmiddlewaretoken". However, the Proctoring Specification requires that the anti-CSRF token be included in the
#    JWT token with the name "session_data". The Proctoring Tool will not direct the browser to send this anti-CSRF
#    token back with the name "csrfmiddlewaretoken", as it's not part of the Proctoring Services Specification.
# This is why we use the csrf_exempt decorator. It exempts this view from CSRF protection for POST requests.
# TODO: From the Django documentation, "This should not be done for POST forms that target external URLs,
#       since that would cause the CSRF token to be leaked, leading to a vulnerability."
#       What does this mean for this endpoint? Is it unsafe to include the CSRF token in the JWT?
